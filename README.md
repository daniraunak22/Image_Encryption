What I'd suggest is creating a repo called "Practice" and anything you don't think HR will care about (tutorials, practice code, etc), all goes in there. Anything you want HR to see, everything gets its own repo with a readme.md file that has the title, link to a working example (if possible), and things like "Why did you make it", "What you learned", "What tech did you use", "what went well", "What went poorly", etc.

This way your github will still look well organized with each important project in their own repo, but all your practice, tutorials, etc, will still be giving you little green squares so it shows HR how busy you've been.
