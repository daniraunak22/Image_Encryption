# Image_Encryption

Project Motivation:

Image processing and cipher techniques are used in various engineering disciplines. One such discipline is biomedical engineering, where these methods are used to perform tasks such as image quality enhancement and data security.
Due to the urgent nature of the medical field, crucial images such as MRI scans, x-rays and ultrasounds often excessive noise due to factors such as low light or fast acquisition times. Techniques like Gaussian filtering and median filtering help reduce noise while preserving important features. For contrast enhancements, methods such as histogram equalization are used to highlight specific structures, improving diagnostic accuracy.
Cipher techniques play a large role in data security for the medical field. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is widely used to protect medical images from unauthorized access. This helps medical agencies comply with privacy regulations such as HIPAA, which mandates the protection of patient information.
Therefore, the applications of this project are massive, being applied in important fields on a day-to-day basis, which is why it is meaningful to learn about image encryption and how intellectual property can be protected.

Key Takeaways:

During this project, I was able to learn how to implement different cyphers to convert messages and encrypt them within images. Specifically, this project helped me gain technical experience with key libraries in Python such as the Image, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. Furthermore, I was also able to learn how to parse through & convert colored and gray images (differentiating between 2D and 3D channels) as well as reading, writing, and manipulating 2D/3D channels.
As one of my first big projects in Python, I think that this project was really successful at helping me learn more about the differne libraries that Python offers and I was also able to effectively learn how to run different ciphers (vigenere, caesar, block, atbash, playfair) to encrypt images. While I was able to learn a lot by completing this project, one thing that I struggle with during this project was finding a solution to how both grayscale and RGB images could be treated the same way when it came to parsing through the pixels and encrypting them (which wasn't as simple as an if statement).
