Course Number: ENGR 13300
Semester: Fall 2024

Description:
    Uses the Vigen√®re cipher to encrypt a string. Specifically, a word can be entered, and then encrypted using a key word. This shifts the indexes, outputting an encrypted word.

    My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor here as well.
